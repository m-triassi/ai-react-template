# Using this Template

This template is primarily used for simply and easily creating React applications with LLMs. It comes pre configured with TailwindCSS and React 19.

To use this template, simply follow these steps:

1. Ask an LLM to generate a React + TailwindCSS application to your specifications
2. Create a repo from this template
3. run the included `init.sh` script to replace placeholder text
4. Paste the results in `App.jsx`
5. Create a Cloudflare project and API token,
6. Set the Cloudflare credentials as Repo Secrets (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`)
7. Push and Commit the code

You should then have a working and deployed react application on cloudflare pages.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/:application_title.git](https://github.com/your-username/:application_title.git)
    cd :application_title
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    or if you use Yarn:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal) to see the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

-   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
-   `npm run lint`: Lints the project files for code quality and style issues using ESLint.
-   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build from the `dist` folder locally to preview it before deployment.
